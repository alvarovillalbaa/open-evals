# Review

Deep review workflow for code, plans, and executive reasoning. This is the "pressure-test it properly" skill in the `business-ops` plugin.

## Use this for

- hard-nosed code or plan review
- automated review pipelines
- executive questioning and "grill me" sessions
- forcing scope clarity before committing to action

## Install

```bash
npx -y skills add ./business-ops/skills/review
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R business-ops/skills/review ~/.codex/skills/
```

## Notes

This skill is intentionally intense. It is best used when the point is to surface weakness, ambiguity, or hidden risk instead of to draft something quickly. The full operating modes are in [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).

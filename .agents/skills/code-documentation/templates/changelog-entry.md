# Changelog Entry Template

Two separate changelogs serve different audiences. Use this template for both, but write completely different content.

---

## Customer-Facing Changelog

**Location:** `CHANGELOG.md` at the service or package root (not in `docs/`). For libraries/packages this is often the repo root.

**Write after release is live. Use plain language — no code names, no error codes, no class names.**

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] — [Optional Release Name]

### New
- [Feature in plain language — focus on user benefit, not implementation]
- [Feature 2]

### Improved
- [Improvement — what's better and how much better]
- [Improvement 2]

### Fixed
- [Bug fix — describe the problem that was fixed, not the code that changed]
- [Bug fix 2]

### Removed
- [Removed feature — what to use instead]
```

### Customer-Facing Examples

```markdown
## 2026-03-08 — Spring Release

### New
- Job matching now considers candidate work preference (remote, hybrid, on-site) when scoring roles
- Recruiters can now bulk-assign candidates to pipeline stages from the list view
- Notifications now support digest mode — receive a daily or weekly summary instead of per-event emails

### Improved
- Candidate search is 3× faster on large datasets (500+ candidates)
- The dashboard now loads in under 1 second on all supported browsers
- Attachment upload now shows real-time progress and supports files up to 100MB

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where some users saw duplicate notifications after reconnecting their Slack integration
- Fixed a layout issue in the sidebar navigation on screens narrower than 1024px

### Removed
- Removed the legacy CSV export format — use the Excel export instead (includes all fields)
```

## Language Guide

### What to say vs. avoid

| ❌ Technical (customer changelog) | ✅ User-focused |
|---|---|
| "Migrated CandidateSerializer to RetrievalLevelMixin" | "Improved loading time for candidate profiles" |
| "Fixed N+1 query in JobListView" | "Job listings now load faster for companies with many open roles" |
| "Added GinIndex on search_vector" | "Search results appear more quickly" |
| "Removed deprecated JobSkillLink model" | "Skill matching has been unified — no action required" |
| "Implemented webhook retry with exponential backoff" | "Integrations are now more reliable — fewer missed events during service disruptions" |

### Verb guide for customer changelogs

- **New:** "Recruiters can now...", "Job matching now...", "Added support for..."
- **Improved:** "X is now 3× faster", "Y now supports...", "Z has been simplified"
- **Fixed:** "Fixed an issue where...", "Resolved a problem that caused..."
- **Removed:** "Removed [X] — use [Y] instead"

### Tone

- Present tense ("Job matching now considers...")
- Active voice ("Recruiters can now...")
- Concrete over vague ("3× faster", not "significantly faster")
- User benefit over feature description ("See which candidates match before reaching out" not "Added match score display")

# Runbook Template

Copy this into `runbooks/<workflow>.md` for repo-wide processes, or `RUNBOOK.md` inside a folder when the procedure is local to that subsystem.

Replace all placeholder text. Keep commands executable and verification steps explicit. Mark dangerous steps before the operator reaches them, and record who owns the workflow plus when it was last verified.

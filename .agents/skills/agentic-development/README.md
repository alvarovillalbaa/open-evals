# Agentic Development

General software-engineering orchestration skill for unfamiliar or complex repositories.

## What it owns now

- repo orientation and instruction-file handling
- execution-mode selection: direct, subagents, team-of-agents, or supervised loops
- architecture analysis, planning, review, verification, release flow, and learning loops
- cross-domain coordination between the specialized frontend and backend skills

## What it no longer owns directly

- frontend implementation depth now lives in [`../frontend/SKILL.md`](../frontend/SKILL.md)
- backend implementation depth now lives in [`../backend/SKILL.md`](../backend/SKILL.md)
